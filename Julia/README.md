# Julia course

This is intended to be a basic introduction to [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
programming language. It is not meant to be an exhaustive introduction: the
reader interested in having additional information about this language will
be able to find much more material over the Internet. Here, only some basic
concepts, necessary for other lectures deposited in this repository, are 
treated.

You may test the provided code snippets directly in the interactive Julia's 
REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which provides a dynamic and immediate way to 
execute Julia code. You can in fact type an expression, Julia will evaluate
it, and the result will be immediately printed. This interactive nature 
makes the REPL perfect for experimenting with new code, testing ideas, 
debugging, and exploring Julia's functionalities.

Every lesson is accompanied with the full code. In Julia, generally
the entire code for one lesson is hold by only one file. If the file is 
named ```code.jl```, then you can then execute it with the command:

	include("code.jl")

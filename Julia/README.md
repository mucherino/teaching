# Julia course

This is intended to be a quick introduction to [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
programming language. It is not meant to be an exhaustive introduction: the
reader interested in having additional information about this language will
be able to find much more material over the Internet. Here, only some basic
concepts, necessary for other lectures deposited in this repository, are 
treated.

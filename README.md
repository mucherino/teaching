# AM's Teaching repository

This repository collects some lecture notes (with code snippets) 
and exercises for the main courses I'm currently teaching at 
University of Rennes, Rennes, France.

New lecture materials are typically uploaded to the repository a few 
days in advance. During lectures, typos or more serious errors may be 
discovered (by myself or students). These are usually corrected in 
subsequent repository commits.

## Lectures by topic

* [Low-level programming](./lowlevel/README.md);
* [GPU programming](./GPU/README.md);
* [Julia programming](./Julia/README.md);
* [Comparing programming languages](./cmp/README.md).

## Exercises

### OOP

* [Quaternions in Java](./OOP/Quaternions.md);
* [The Node: first step to design collections](./OOP/TheNode.md);
* [MU-puzzle and linked lists](./OOP/MU-puzzle.md).

### HPC

#### Java multithreading

* [MultiAgentSSP](./HPC/MultiAgentSSP.md): several agents acting in parallel for the solution of a combinatorial problem!
* [AirSimulation](./HPC/AirSimulation/README.md): parallel agents in charge to reserve plane seats.

#### OpenMP

* [OpenMP for beginners](./HPC/OpenMPbeginners.c) (just compile, run, and follow the instructions).

### GPU

* [Computing the natural log of 2 on GPU](./GPU/log2series.md);
* [Matrix transposition on GPU](./GPU/mattranspose.md).

### The Game of life

* [One exercise](./HPC/game/README.md) to practise your implementation skills in both MPI and CUDA!

## Last updates

Two new exercises:

* the MU-puzzle;
* the MultiAgent SSP solver.

# AM's Teaching repository

This repository collects some lecture notes (with code snippets) 
and exercises for the main courses I'm currently teaching at 
University of Rennes, Rennes, France.

The material for new lectures is generally added to the repository
a few days before the lectures take place. It is often the case that
typos (or even more important mistakes) are discovered during the
lectures (by myself, or by my students): these are then corrected
in subsequently commits on the repository.

## Lectures by topic

* [Low-level programming](./lowlevel/README.md);
* [GPU programming](./GPU/README.md);
* [Julia programming](./Julia/README.md);
* [Comparing programming languages](./cmp/README.md).

## Exercises

### OOP

* [Quaternions in Java](./OOP/Quaternions.md);
* [The Node: first step to design collections](./OOP/TheNode.md).

### HPC

* [AirSimulation in Java multithreading](./HPC/AirSimulation/README.md);
* [OpenMP for beginners](./HPC/OpenMPbeginners.c) (just compile, run, and follow the instructions).

### GPU

* [Computing the natural log of 2 on GPU](./GPU/log2series.md);
* [Matrix transposition on GPU](./GPU/mattranspose.md).

### The Game of life

* [One exercise](./HPC/game/README.md) to practise your implementation skills in both MPI and CUDA!

## Last updates

* reorganization of Julia course, data structures and multiple-dispatch;
* lecture on GPU streams and the Sierpinski fractal.

# AM's Teaching repository

This repository collects some lecture notes (with code snippets) 
and exercises for the main courses I'm currently teaching at 
University of Rennes, Rennes, France.

New lecture materials are typically uploaded to the repository a few 
days in advance. During lectures, typos or more serious errors may be 
discovered (by myself or students). These are usually corrected in 
subsequent repository commits.

## Lectures by topic

* [Low-level programming](./lowlevel/README.md);
* [GPU programming](./GPU/README.md);
* [Julia programming](./Julia/README.md);
* [Mathematical programming](./Julia/math-prog.md);
* [Comparing programming languages](./cmp/README.md).

## Exercises

### Object-oriented programming and data structures

* [Quaternions in Java](./OOP/Quaternions.md);
* [The Node and its important role in collections](./OOP/TheNode.md);
* [MU-puzzle and linked lists](./OOP/MU-puzzle.md).

### Concurrent programming

* [OpenMP for beginners](./HPC/OpenMPbeginners.c) (in C, just compile, run, and follow the instructions).
* [MultiAgentSSP](./HPC/MultiAgentSSP.md): several Java agents acting in parallel for the solution of a combinatorial problem!
* [AirSimulation](./HPC/AirSimulation/README.md): several Java agents in charge to make airline reservations.

### GPU programming

* [Prime factorization](./GPU/primes.md);
* [Computing the natural log of 2](./GPU/log2series.md);
* [Matrix transposition](./GPU/mattranspose.md).

### The Game of life

* [One exercise](./HPC/game/README.md) to practise your implementation skills in both MPI and CUDA!

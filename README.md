# AM's Teaching repository

This repository collects some lecture notes (with code snippets) 
and exercises for the main courses I'm currently teaching at 
University of Rennes, Rennes, France.

New lecture materials are typically uploaded to the repository a few 
days in advance. During lectures, typos or more serious errors may be 
discovered (by myself or students). These are usually corrected in 
subsequent repository commits.

## Lectures by topic

* [Low-level programming](./lowlevel/README.md);
* [GPU programming](./GPU/README.md);
* [Julia programming](./Julia/README.md);
* [Comparing programming languages](./cmp/README.md).

## Exercises

### OOP

* [Quaternions in Java](./OOP/Quaternions.md);
* [The Node: first step to design collections](./OOP/TheNode.md).

### HPC

* [AirSimulation in Java multithreading](./HPC/AirSimulation/README.md);
* [OpenMP for beginners](./HPC/OpenMPbeginners.c) (just compile, run, and follow the instructions).

### GPU

* [Computing the natural log of 2 on GPU](./GPU/log2series.md);
* [Matrix transposition on GPU](./GPU/mattranspose.md).

### The Game of life

* [One exercise](./HPC/game/README.md) to practise your implementation skills in both MPI and CUDA!

## Last updates

* lecture 2 of GPU programming course;
* reorganization of Julia course, data structures and multiple-dispatch.

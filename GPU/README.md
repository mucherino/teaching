# GPU programming

The content of this page represents an entire course for the 
[ESIR](https://esir.univ-rennes.fr/en/welcome-eisr-graduate-school-excellence)
engineering school of University of Rennes, and partially for the parallel 
computing course taught at [ISTIC](https://istic.univ-rennes.fr/).
This second course is given in collaboration with my colleague
[CÃ©dric Tedeschi](http://people.irisa.fr/Cedric.Tedeschi/index.html).
